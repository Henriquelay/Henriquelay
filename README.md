I like building stuff. I wish I had more time to.

I'm not a huge fan of web, but I can do it fine. I love building "complicated" applications like compilers and crunchy stuff.

My next project is gonna be something math related, like a Pi or Fibonacci calculator. Maybe a primes generator.

I'm also eyeing making an interpreter for ISO Prolog. Or maybe a simple game with Bevy.
